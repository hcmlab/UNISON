The town hall

Every third round in the evening there is a town hall meeting, such that players can join the town hall in these rounds and develop petitions that are then laid out in the town hall for a vote to be decided upon by all players throughout the next three days. During the daytime phase players can vote here until the next town hall meeting. Decisions affect the gameplay.
