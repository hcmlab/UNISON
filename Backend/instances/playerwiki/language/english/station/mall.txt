•	The mall (supermarket, bank, pharmacy), where players can purchase goods and services that they require or are helpful for the game.
Goods and services available:
•	Health points:
Players can purchase HP for 10 MU. The first purchase gives them 10 HP, the second 5HP, the third 2.5 HP, etc.
•	A disinfectant:
The disinfectant disables the possibility of being infected for its buyer in a given round. It does not protect other players from infection. For an infectious player the disinfectant is therefore useless. The price is 10 MU.
•	A health check gives you information about your SL, HP and IS. It costs 20 MU.
•	The vaccine fund:
Players can invest into vaccine development. With increasing collective investment, the likelihood of a vaccine being spontaneously developed at the beginning of a round increases.
The stock fund:
You can purchase stocks and get a small dividend for it. Additionally, the productivity of all players will slightly increase, resulting in a higher payroll at the office.
•	Bank transfer to send money to other players. This transaction does not imply fees.
